### Hello there

About Me : 
I'm currently ~~a Btech student at IIT KGP(Grad Yr 2024)~~ Nay just doing an online course for 1 lac sem fee.
I mostly use python, but do have the basics of C/C++
I'm pretty new around here, and the project count's low.
But you can go through them and contribute if you feel like :)

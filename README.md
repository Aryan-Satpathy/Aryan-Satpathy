## Hey there !

<!--
About Me : 
I'm currently ~~a Btech student at IIT KGP(Grad Yr 2024)~~ Nay just doing an online course for 1 lac sem fee.
I mostly use python, but do have the basics of C/C++
I'm pretty new around here, and the project count's low.
But you can go through them and contribute if you feel like :)

### About me 

  I'm an electonics and electrical communication engineering student at IIT Kharagpur (2024 batch).
  My primary language is Python but I can do C, C#, C++.
  I'm interested in deep learning and robotics and looking forward to learn more.
  I've had a sudden interest surge in the field of rendering and how Shaders work.
  I'm pretty new around here and project count's low, but feel free to go through them and contribute üôÇ
